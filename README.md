# Chapter 1: The To Do List

While the first chapter includes downloading and installing Flask, as well as getting familiar with some Python web frameworks, this repository will include only the code used in building the To Do list, both back and front end.

If you want to see this project built step by step, follow the branches of the repository:

- `master` will include the finished product.
- `checkpoint-00` is the initial commit, with just the most basic file structure
